# Customized CSS Design â€“ Springtime in Michigan

This project is part of the *Web Design for Everybody* specialization on Coursera.  
The original website, **Springtime in Michigan**, was provided as a starter template.  

## Changes I Made
- Replaced the default images with animated pictures I personally selected.  
- Modified fixed pixel widths into percentages (%) to improve responsiveness.  
- Adjusted layout and styling to make the design look more engaging and flexible across devices.  

## Purpose
This project demonstrates my understanding of CSS styling, responsive design, and customization.  
It also reflects my ability to take a given template and transform it into something unique and personal.
